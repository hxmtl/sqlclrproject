SQLCLRPROJECT

SqlClrProject is a custom Visual Studio (VS) project type used for creation and deployment of CLR assemblies to SQL Server and an add-in for the Visual Studio IDE. This was originally created for SQL Server 2005 and Visual Studio 2005. Later it was upgraded to support SQL 2008 and VS 2008.

It is a looooong time since I have worked on it, but if anyone want to have a go at it - please go ahead!

You can find documentation about the project in the setup folder.
