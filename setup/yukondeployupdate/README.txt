This is the installation for the updated yukondeploy.dll.

To run this you need access to the gacutil tool in .NET 2.0. Easiest way to get access is to open the Visual Studio 2005 or the .NET SDK command prompt	
To set this up; open a command prompt in the .\setup directory and run the install.bat file.

After installation, the MSBUILD task dll (yukondeploy.dll) has been re-installed into the GAC, and you can start utilizing the new functionality.
